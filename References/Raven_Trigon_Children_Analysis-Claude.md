## Raven: Core Character Analysis

### Origins and Background

Raven was conceived when the interdimensional demon lord Trigon raped Arella (originally Angela), a human woman who had joined a religious cult seeking spiritual enlightenment. Arella was rescued by the benevolent beings of Azarath, an extradimensional realm dedicated to peace and spiritual purity. There, Raven was born and raised by the Azarathians, particularly the priest Azar, who taught her to suppress her emotions and demonic heritage.

**Core Identity Conflict:**
- **Demonic Heritage:** Inherited from Trigon - destructive power, potential for evil, emotional volatility
- **Human Heritage:** Inherited from Arella - capacity for love, empathy, moral reasoning

2. **Soul-Self Projection**

### Relationship with Trigon

**Core Dynamic:**
- **Trigon's Goals:** Use Raven as a portal/anchor to enter and conquer Earth's dimension
- **Raven's Resistance:** Constant struggle to maintain her humanity and resist her father's influence
- **Power Correlation:** The more Raven uses her demonic powers, the stronger Trigon's influence becomes
- **Emotional Vulnerability:** Strong emotions (especially anger, hatred, or despair) make Raven susceptible to corruption
