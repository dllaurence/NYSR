My comments are in double square brackets: [[ ]]

[Chorus]
Hush, child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep
Child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep

[Verse 1]
Guileless son, I'll shape your belief
And you'll always know that your father's a thief
And you won't understand the cause of your grief
But you'll always follow the voices beneath

[[In each chorus, this is sung by quiet voices in the background and may well represent the ominous "voices beneath" that Morgan predicts that Mordred would always follow. Presumably this is without knowing why or even that the voices are there, manipulating him. They are quite possibly the voice of Morgan le Fay, but for game purposes I have decided that they are evil, whispering entities summoned and controlled by Morgan and always present in his head as part of her magical brainwashing of Mordred.]]
(Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty only to me)

[Verse 2]
Guileless son, your spirit will hate her
The flower who married my brother the traitor
And you will expose his puppeteer behavior
For you are the proof of how he betrayed her loyalty

(Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty only to me)

[Chorus]
Hush, child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep
Child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep

(Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty only to me)

[Verse 3]
Guileless son, each day you grow older
Each moment I'm watching my vengeance unfold
For the child of my body, the flesh of my soul
Will die in returning the birthright he stole

(Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty only to me)

[Chorus]
Hush, child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep
Child, the darkness will rise from the deep
And carry you down into sleep
