# Raven (DC) — Canon Survey, Powers, Trigon, and Sibling Variants

_Last updated: 2025‑09‑24 • Built for NotebookLM • Focus: power design for children of Trigon, Raven–Trigon dynamics, and cross‑media comparisons._

---

## 0) Orientation & Use
- **Identity:** Raven (Rachel Roth) is a half‑demon empath–mage from **Azarath**, daughter of **Trigon** (demon lord) and **Arella** (human). Created by Marv Wolfman & George Pérez, she debuts recruiting the Titans against Trigon.
- **Signature mechanic:** the **Soul‑Self** (often a giant raven) — an astral/avatar form used for offense, defense, scouting, telepathy/teleportation, and emotion‑work.
- **Enduring conflict:** demon‑blood destiny vs. self‑chosen ethics/family; control/containment vs. compassion/connection.

**How to use this doc:** Each section is self‑contained (comics, Teen Titans 2003, Titans live‑action, other media). After Raven’s sections, see **§6** for **other children of Trigon** and **§7–§8** for side‑by‑side comparisons and design tools.

---

## 1) Raven — Powers (cross‑continuity synthesis)
**Empathy & emotion control.** Baseline: sense/share/dampen emotions, pain, and illness; escalation: induce or modulate states (with overload risk in high‑affect crowds).

**Soul‑Self (astral avatar).** Projects as a combat/utility entity to shield, absorb, grapple, scout, communicate, and traverse/teleport. Early time limits relax in later eras.

**Magic/sorcery toolkit.** Telekinesis, shadow/darkness constructs, teleportation, hypnosis, ritual magic (chants/sigils), occasional precognition; in some runs, framed as **chaos‑magic** proficiency.

**Demonic surge/aspect.** Red‑skinned or multi‑eyed “demonic” form boosts durability, strength, and destructive spell output. Some continuities add **Seven Deadly Sins induction** (notably **Pride**) with physiological backlash.

**Limiters & weaknesses.** Emotional overload; corruption/possession vectors (Trigon, cults, artifacts); susceptibility to great magic; ethics of over‑dampening others.

> **Design cue (for new Trigon‑child):** Treat **empathy + astral avatar** as the base idiom; layer **chaos‑magic utilities**; add a **Demonic Surge** state gated by mantras/rituals with tangible costs (fatigue, visions, attracting Trigon’s gaze).

---

## 2) Raven — Relationship with Trigon (story patterns to mine)
1. **Prophecy pressure.** Cults (e.g., Church of Blood; The Organization) work time‑tabled rites that need Raven’s presence/consent or despair to breach dimensions.
2. **Possession & splitting.** Trigon’s influence externalizes as corruption, dark doppelgängers, or a split‑off “Evil/Dark Raven,” letting inner conflict become set‑piece action.
3. **Chosen‑family counter‑magic.** Titans’ trust/friendship provides affective ballast, blocking leverage; intimacy reframes destiny.
4. **Collateral kin.** Rival half‑siblings test her autonomy with loyalty/temptation trials; artifacts and sigils escalate or bind.

> **Plot kit:** Make the child a **living seal** (emotions “open” or “close” it). Use **sin‑specialists** among siblings; build **cult factionalism** (bind vs. unleash) the PCs can exploit.

---

## 3) Raven in Comics (major eras)
**Classic / New Teen Titans (1980s).** Gothic melodrama + found family. Raven recruits the Titans when the JLA balks (demonic taint). Repeated Trigon‑incursion prevention; relapse/possession cycles; Azarath discipline as ethical frame.

**Late 80s–90s (Titans Hunt / Evil Raven).** Soul‑splitting, corruption, and ritual cleansing (Phantasm). “Seed of Trigon” beats weaponize intimacy; wedding‑crash arc with Starfire illustrates moral chess Raven plays against her own taint.

**2000s (Johns era and adjacent).** “Family Lost / Raven Rising,” and **half‑brothers** arcs. Raven re‑joins the Titans with contingency artifacts that can kill her if corrupted — trust‑with‑safeguards as a motif.

**2010s–2020s (New 52 / Prime Earth and later).** Re‑introduction via **Phantom Stranger** and **Teen Titans (vol. 4)**; visual redesigns; “Black Bird of Terror” epithet; later **Dark Raven/Doctor Hate** threads interrogate autonomy vs. destiny with Lords‑of‑Chaos artifacts.

---

## 4) Raven in **Teen Titans (2003–2006)**
**Characterization.** Guarded, sardonic, tender beneath discipline. The series foregrounds **emotion‑regulation** as the visible limiter (focus mantra **“Azarath Metrion Zinthos”**).

**On‑screen power language.** Telekinesis (debris swarms), force shields/absorption, phasing, short‑hop teleport, soul‑avatar strikes — all explicitly keyed to emotional control.

**Trigon arc (Season 4).** Prophecy pressure and catastrophic coming‑of‑age; team‑as‑family breaks fatalism. Raven’s culminating state (often dubbed **“White Raven”** by fans) channels full power without surrendering compassion.

> **Design cue:** Implement **focus checks/mantra tokens** to gate large‑scale effects; failure spawns uncontrollable shadow phenomena the party must contain.

---

## 5) Raven in **Titans (2018–2023, live‑action)**
**Premise.** Rachel Roth as runaway empath haunted by a monster‑in‑the‑mirror; the Titans function as guardians before peers.

**Cults & kin.** The **Organization** and **Church of Blood** drive grooming/prophecy plots; later seasons add **Sebastian Sanger** (Brother Blood), another child of Trigon, to contrast Raven’s refusal with sibling embrace of destiny.

**Powers on screen.** Early volatility (prophetic/trauma‑keyed outbursts) that consolidate into intentional magic; the show also nods to the “**White Raven**” metamorphosis as an achieved confidence/state.

> **Design cue:** Early play uses **noisy, prophetic, hard‑to‑aim** manifestations; later arcs reward investment in bonds/rituals with precision and breadth.

---

## 6) **Other Children of Trigon** (by continuity / medium)

### 6.1 New Earth (pre‑Flashpoint) — **The Sons of Trigon (Seven Sins)**
- **Jared (Wrath).** Induces murderous rage; leadership push among brothers. Typical mission: weaponize riots/warbands.
- **Jacob (Lust).** Induces compulsive desire/obsession; excels at infiltration and corruption of alliances.
- **Jesse (Envy).** Induces corrosive jealousy; specializes in breaking trust networks (teams, courts, churches).
- **James (Greed).** Induces avarice; logistics/treasure and artifact‑hunting anchor.
- **Jack (Sloth).** Induces apathy; targeted demoralization of defenders and institutions.
- **“Gluttony.”** The gluttonous aspect appears variably named in adaptations; often used for grotesque body‑horror escalation and mass‑consumption set pieces.

**Mechanic.** The brothers typically **induce/weaponize** their sin in others; they also corrupt Raven or try to use her as a **key**. Motive varies between unleashing Trigon and **usurping** him by siphoning his power.

### 6.2 Prime Earth / New 52 (2010s–) — **Belial, Ruskoff, Suge**
- **Belial.** Eldest/ambitious half‑demon prince; wartime organizer among siblings; frequently the field commander in assaults to reclaim Raven.
- **Ruskoff.** Loyalist lieutenant; demon‑physiology powerhouse (brute force, resilience).
- **Suge.** Loyalist lieutenant; demon‑physiology with battlefield cunning; sometimes linked to broader Hell politics.

**Mechanic.** Less “sin‑induction,” more **direct demonic power** (strength, durability, sorcery) with coordinated assaults on Titans; theme: **dynastic succession** in Hell vs. Raven’s autonomy.

### 6.3 Prime Earth (2023–) — **Trilogy (Liam) and Brothers**
- **Trilogy (Liam).** Half‑human child awakened by **Lazarus rain**; powers include **possession, shapeshifting, superhuman physicals**; defined by **mistrust** and grim piety. His two unnamed brothers manifest, but are killed early by Trigon in a manipulative recruitment scene.

**Mechanic.** Post‑Lazarus Planet framing: ambient magical catastrophe **activates dormant demonic lineages**, creating “wild” heirs with unstable ethics and power expression.

### 6.4 Titans (live‑action) — **Sebastian Sanger (Brother Blood)**
- **Identity.** Human cult‑raised son of Trigon (with May Bennett/Mother Mayhem); ascends as **Brother Blood**.
- **Powers.** Blood‑magic amplification, ritual empowerment keyed to prophecy, leadership of the Church of Blood; contrasted with Raven’s empathy/containment ethic.

**Mechanic.** Embraces destiny; narrative foil who **chooses the throne** Trigon offers, making family conflict ideological as well as mystical.

### 6.5 DC Animated Films / Games — **Sons of Trigon (adaptational)**
- **DCAMU & DC Universe Online** versions often list/badge the brothers by the sins (**Jared/Wrath, Jacob/Lust, Jesse/Envy, James/Greed, Jack/Sloth, Julius/Gluttony**), sometimes treating **Raven as Pride** and plotting reunification.

> **Continuity caution:** Names/rosters vary by medium. Use the **sin‑function** as the portable mechanic; treat individual names as **continuity‑specific**.

## 7) Comparison Matrix — Raven vs. Trigon’s Other Children

| Character / Continuity | Primary Power Idiom | Limiter / Cost | Typical Relationship to Trigon | Narrative Function |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Raven (comics, general)** | Empathy + **Soul‑Self** + ritual magic; optional sin‑induction (Pride) | Emotional overload; corruption vectors; ethical restraint | Resists/rewrites destiny; oscillates between corruption and purification | Wounded‑healer lead; “family counter‑magic” anchor |
| **Raven (Teen Titans 2003)** | Emotion‑gated telekinesis/constructs, shields, teleport; mantra focus | Loss of control if unfocused; social isolation | Opposes Trigon through chosen family; prophecy inversion | Stoic teen learns trust; **White Raven** catharsis |
| **Raven (Titans live‑action)** | Volatile empathic/mystic bursts → disciplined magic over time | Trauma triggers; trust work with guardians | Recruited then resists; acts as sibling foil to Sebastian | Survivor narrative; guardian‑to‑peer arc |
| **Jared/Jacob/Jesse (New Earth)** | **Sin‑induction** (Wrath/Lust/Envy) to mass‑manipulate | Overreach backfires; reliance on victims’ susceptibility | Oscillate between unleashing/overthrowing Trigon | Antagonists who corrupt teams and spark inner collapse |
| **James/Jack/Julius** (adaptational) | Greed/Sloth/Gluttony expressions; often body‑horror or mass sway | Similar to above | Often try to reunite the “seven” (with Raven as Pride) | Escalation set pieces; artifact hunts |
| **Belial/Ruskoff/Suge (Prime Earth)** | **Direct demonic force** (strength, sorcery, command) | Hierarchy infighting; ritual dependencies | Loyal to Trigon or seek succession via conquest | War‑arc antagonists; Hell‑politics channel |
| **Trilogy (Liam)** (Prime Earth) | Possession, shapeshift, super‑physicals; Lazarus‑triggered | Unstable identity; religious guilt; isolation | Personally courted by Trigon; siblings killed as leverage | Dark mirror of “salvation vs. damnation” |
| **Sebastian Sanger** (Titans TV) | Blood magic + cult rites; prophetic empowerment | Dependency on cult; moral descent | **Embraces** Trigon’s plan | Ideological foil; “what if Raven said yes” |

## 8) Design Toolkit — Building **Your** Child of Trigon

**8.1 Power tiers**
- **Tier 1 (always‑on):** Empathic sense + micro‑dampening; Soul‑Self scout; shadow wisps (micro‑telekinesis).
- **Tier 2 (focused):** Barrier “Soul‑Shell,” short‑hop teleport, emotion push/pull with consent mechanics; wards/sigils.
- **Tier 3 (Demonic Surge):** Multi‑eye sigil opens; chaos‑beamwork, sin‑specialty, dimension keys (portals/bindings). **Costs:** nausea/visions, exhaustion, pings Trigon/cults.

**8.2 Limiters & safeguards**
- **Mantras/rituals** (Azarath discipline) as concentration checks;
- **Counter‑artifacts** (stabilizers that also act as trackers);
- **Overload checks** in crowds/trauma zones;
- **Trust pacts** with teammates as mechanical buffers.

**8.3 Plot engines**
- **Seal mechanics:** emotional states open/close gateways;
- **Sibling sin‑guilds:** each sibling specializes in a sin/emotion;
- **Cult schisms:** bind vs. unleash factions the PCs can play off;
- **Doppel mechanic:** repression over time sheds a Dark‑Self the party must resolve.

---

## 9) Literary Lens — Raven as Dark‑Heart Healer
- **Archetype braid:** _Wounded Healer_ (takes others’ pain), _Tempted Scion_ (heir to evil), _Psychopomp_ (soul‑traveler). Soul‑Self dramatizes interiority as action.
- **Ethics of containment:** Azarath training reframes power as **care**, not domination; stories test the line between helping and overriding agency.
- **Family as counter‑spell:** Chosen bonds repeatedly **reprogram prophecy** — intimacy as magic system.

---

## 10) Quick Index (versions at a glance)
- **Comics:** Classic NTT; Titans Hunt/Evil Raven; 2000s half‑brothers arcs; New 52/Prime Earth; Dark Raven/Doctor Hate.
- **Animation:** Teen Titans (2003–06) + _Trouble in Tokyo_; Teen Titans Go! (parodic/elastic); DC Nation shorts.
- **Films/Games:** DC Animated Movie Universe appearances; **DC Universe Online** “Sons of Trigon.”
- **Live Action:** _Titans_ (2018–2023): Trigon, Church of Blood, **Sebastian Sanger**, “White Raven” nods.
