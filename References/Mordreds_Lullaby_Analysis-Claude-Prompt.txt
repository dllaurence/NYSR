Please do a deep literary analysis of the lyrics to Heather Dale's song "Mordred's Lullaby. Discuss subtle subtexts and allusions both inside and outside the Arthurian corpus. Look for deeper meanings, though of course you must not neglect obvious surface meanings. Put special emphasis on the character of the singer and of Mordred, for the latter especially for how the singer's manipulation has shaped him into her tool and how it differs from who he might have been had she not done so.
