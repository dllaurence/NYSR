I uploaded a PDF of Fred Saberhagen's novel Dominion in PDF. Please do a deep analysis like an English professor would. Explain the plot structure and details, for example all the different aspects of Vivian grand plot. How does it work, and does it logically hold together? How does she ensure the compliance of her unwitting victim-accomplices? Make a careful analysis of how the character Simon Hill fits the plot and a psychological analysis of his character and particularly his manipulation by Vivian. Also analyze Saberhagen's use of historical vs modern sources and how he merges (or doesn't merge) the female characters in the historical legends into his Vivian character. Analyze Saberhagen's use of names, particularly multiple names, for his characters and Merlin and Vivian in particular. What is he conveying by the multiple names? Also look at what we can tell of the more or less off-stage character Falerin. Does he have a basis in the historical legends, the modern fiction, or is he de novo for Saberhagen's novel? Provide reference links.
