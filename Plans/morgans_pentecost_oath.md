# Morgan’s Pentecost Oath

**Version:** 1.0  

> *I have kept the watch through the night.*  
> 
> *I stand at the edge of the day,*  
> *where darkness loosens its hold*  
> *and what is sworn may yet be spoken.*  
> 
> *Before the breath that moves unseen,*  
> *before the fire that gives voice and resolve,*  
> *and before the witness who hears and may not speak,*  
> *I set my will and swear.*  
> 
> *By the blade I bear,*  
> *and by the strength that sustains it,*  
> *I bind myself to the watch laid upon me—*  
> *whether I sought it or not.*  
> 
> *I will stand for the defenseless:*  
> *for women and for children,*  
> *for the innocent,*  
> *for the forgotten,*  
> *and for those whom no one else will guard.*  
> 
> *I will offer mercy where mercy is asked,*  
> *and I will stay my hand against the one who yields,*  
> *even when such mercy is turned against me,*  
> *and even when the cost is mine alone.*  
> 
> *I will not abandon my brothers in the watch,*  
> *nor betray them in word or deed,*  
> *nor place my own safety above their keeping,*  
> *so long as I am able to stand beside them.*  
> 
> *I will speak truth as I am able,*  
> *bear witness when others turn away,*  
> *and hold fast when honor brings no reward.*  
> 
> *I take this oath freely,*  
> *without promise of victory,*  
> *without assurance of justice,*  
> *and without claim to rest or release.*  
> 
> *Let this vow bind me while I live.*  
> *Let it shape my hand and my will.*  
> *Let me be broken by it before I break it,*  
> *and let the fire that hears these words*  
> *hold me to them*  
> *until the watch is ended.*

*— sworn at first light*
