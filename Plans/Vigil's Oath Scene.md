# Vigil's Oath Scene

## Setup

- Vigil goes to St. Giles' Chapel-On-The-River around 9 PM, before Father Thomas locks the doors.

- Around 10 PM Father Thomas Hale makes his last rounds. Seeing a supplicant kneeling, he leaves quietly and locks the doors. He never turns away the earnest pentitent or supplicant.

- Around first light (Astronomical dawn), say 5:45, Father Thomas hears a back door shut. He has had break ins and so he goes to investigate. The chapel is empty. He goes out the back door, toward the river rather than the street.

- Vigil is kneeling facing the river, stars still in the sky, holding his spectral blade in the sign of the cross.

## Oath

- Vigil says firmly "**Lady! I have fulfilled your command and won a place at the Round Table! Witness my pentecost oath! Grant me the power to fight well alongside my brother knights with your blessing and token.**"

- Morgan rises from the water, visible only to Vigil. To Fr. Thomas Vigil is talking to the empty water. "**Rise.**"

- Vigil rises to his feet, his sign of the cross held high.

- Morgan: "**Swear.**"

- Vigil takes the oath.

- At "I take this oath freely" both his and Morgan's eyes glow deep Green.

## Aftermath

- Their eyes cease glowing.

- Morgan says "**Idiot boy! Why did you alter the oath? I am the witness, who is this one who may not speak?**"

- Vigil says "**But I did not...**"

- Father Thomas creeps quietly back through the door, but Morgan sees him.

- Morgan says "**Ah. We are not alone. That will cost you your life, fool priest.**"

- Morgan gestures. Green power flares at her fingertips, but nothing happens. An angry expression briefly crosses her face, then calm. She continues "**I see. That role was not meant to be, but is now part of the myth. I may not touch you until the end is written. I wish you joy in playing a part that you did not choose and cannot comprehend.**"

- She turns back to Vigil and holds up her hand. He kneels and bows his head in supplication. "**So be it. Be valorous, and your might shall match your valor.**" Vigil's amulet glows with new power. He raises his head but remains kneeling. Morgan stretches out her hands in benediction and says "**The first binding is complete. You have sworn by your will and with my power. Be true to what you have sworn. Keep faith with the fate you have chosen, and it will keep faith with you. Become what you are meant to be.**"

- Morgan sinks beneath the waves.

- Vigil again kneels. The sword vanishes. He turns to leave as the stars wink out one by one.
