# Vigil’s Pentecost Oath

*Version: 1.0*

*
> I have kept the watch through the night and stand at the edge of the day.
> 
> Before the witness who hears and may not speak, I set my will and swear.
> 
> By the blade I bear, I bind myself to the watch laid upon me.
> 
> Whether I sought it or no, this charge is laid upon me:
> 
> I will stand for the defenseless:
> for the innocent,
> for the forgotten,
> and for those whom no one else will guard.
> 
> I will offer mercy where mercy is asked,
> and I will stay my hand against the one who yields,
> even when such mercy is turned against me,
> and even when the cost is mine alone.
> 
> I will not abandon my brothers in the watch,
> nor betray them in word or deed,
> nor place my own safety above their keeping,
> so long as I am able to stand beside them.
> 
> I will speak truth as I am able,  
> bear witness when others turn away,  
> and hold fast when honor brings no reward.
> 
> I take this oath freely,
> 
> without promise of victory orassurance of justice,  
> ithout claim to rest or release.
> 
> Let this vow bind me while I live.  
> Let it shape my hand and my will.  
> Let me be broken by it before I break it,  
> held to it until the last watch is ended.
