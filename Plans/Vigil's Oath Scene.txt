Vigil's Pentecost Oath

St Giles' Chapel-On-The-Water, Swindler Cove, Inwood, Manhattan

An elderly priest makes his nightly rounds of the old stone chapel in his care. Finding Vigil kneeling before the altar in the Chancel, beneath the Rood Cross, Father Thomas quietly shuts the door and finishes locking the outer doors. He never disturbs a penitent, and the doors will lock behind the visitor when he leaves. The moonlight reflects off the water as he finishes his nightly prayers in the small cell behind the Vestry.

Around first light, stars still shining bright, Father Thomas is awakened by the shutting of the back door leading to the river. Concerned, he quickly dresses and checks the chapel. It is empty. He goes out the back door onto the stone path to the beach. His concern turns to astonishment when beyond the trees he sees Vigil kneeling again, this time at the end of the small pier, a green glow at his breast and his spectral blade held pommel upward in the sign of the cross. He is just in time to hear Vigil say loudly and firmly "Lady! I have fulfilled your command and won a place at the Round Table! I beseech thee, Witness my Pentecost Oath, and grant me the power to fight well alongside my brother knights with your blessing and token!"

The old priest's puzzlement grows at the boy speaking so earnestly to nothing but the river; he cannot see the commanding presence of a tall, slender, regal woman rising from the water nor hear her say in a voice dripping with authority "Rise!" Only Vigil sees. He always sees.

Vigil rises as he was bid, the pommel of his blade at eye level. The Queenly Lady waits a pregnant moment, then speaks in a voice dripping with command and ritual: "Swear!"

An unseasonable breeze begins to blow from the river. Vigil lifts the pommel high above his head and speaks as though reciting a creed:

    I have kept faithful watch through the night and stand at the edge of the day.
    Before the witness who hears and may not speak, I set my will and swear.
    Whether I sought it or no, by the blade I bear I bind myself to the charge laid upon me:

Vigil swallows, and the breeze freshens.

    I will stand for the defenseless, the innocent, the forgotten,
    Staying my hand in mercy and sparing a foe who yields,
    Even when such mercy is turned against me and the cost is mine alone.

    I will not abandon my brothers in the watch, nor betray them in word or deed,
    Nor place my own safety above their keeping, so long as I stand beside them.

    I will speak sooth and bear witness where others turn away.
    I will hold fast when honor brings no reward.

Vigil pauses, and both his eyes and The Lady's eyes begin to glow deep green. The priest starts; he could explain talking to no one in many ways, but he cannot explain the eldritch aura in Vigil's eyes. The breeze becomes a brisk wind, and Vigil continues, more loudly now:

    I take this oath freely,
    Without promise of victory or assurance of justice,
    Without claim to rest or release.

    Let this vow bind me while I live.
    Let it shape my hand and my will.
    Let me be broken by it before I break it,
    Kept inviolate until the last watch is ended.

Vigil and the Lady remain silent and motionless until the glow in their eyes fades and the wind dies. After a moment her face contorts in anger: "Wretched boy! Why did you alter the oath? I am the witness, who is this one who may not speak?"

Vigil replies "But I did not..." as the priest backs on tiptoe up the trail in fear.

The Lady's eyes narrow, and she says "Ah. We are not alone. That will cost you your life, fool priest." She gestures, green power flaring at her fingertips. The priest halts as if held, struggling to no avail, but nothing more. Her face fills with annoyance, then fades to calm: "I see. That role was not meant to be, but is chosen by the Myth itself. I may not touch you...yet. Until the end is written, I wish you joy in playing a part that you cannot reckon." The priest hears nothing but a final gust of wind breaking the stillness.

She turns back to Vigil and holds up her hand. Vigil bows his head in submission. "You have requested a boon. So be it. Be valorous, and your might shall match your valor." Vigil's amulet glows brighter. He raises his head but remains silent. The Lady stretches out her hands in benediction and says "The second binding is complete. You have sworn by your will and with my power. Be upright and true to the end. Follow the fate that follows you. Become what you are meant to be."

Vigil again kneels, and after a long pause Vigil's sword vanishes and the glow at his chest winks out as the Lady sinks beneath the water. At this, the priest finds himself able to move again and flees back up the path, his face a mixture of terror and bewilderment. Vigil stands and turns to leave as the stars wink out one by one.
