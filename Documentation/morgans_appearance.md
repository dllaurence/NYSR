# Morgan le Fay – Appearance Reference

**Document Version:** v1.0

## Overall Impression

Morgan le Fay presents as **tall, slender, and regally composed**, her physical presence communicating power through stillness and verticality rather than mass or overt physical force. In motion she is minimal and deliberate; when she appears, the world seems to arrange itself around her rather than the reverse.

Her bearing is unmistakably that of a queen and sorceress rather than a warrior: upright posture, long lines, and an air of ancient certainty. Even when emerging from water or shadow, she appears unhurried and complete, as though the environment were merely revealing what was already there.

## Build and Proportions

- **Physique:** Slender, willowy, long-limbed
- **Musculature:** Minimal visible definition; strength is implied rather than displayed
- **Silhouette:** Elongated and vertical; robes and garments emphasize height and flow rather than curves

Her physical form is not fragile, but it is never heavy. She reads as someone who has never needed to rely on physical force.

## Height and Weight (Game-Use Estimate)

These values are intended to be **consistent with Marvel visual portrayals** and suitable for a Champions character sheet.

- **Height:** ~5'11" to 6'1" (180–185 cm)
  - Most consistent visual read: **~6'0" (183 cm)**

- **Weight:** ~135–145 lb (61–66 kg)
  - Most consistent estimate: **~140 lb (64 kg)**

These values place her as clearly tall for a woman, notably slender for her height, and visually imposing without appearing physically powerful.

## Face and Features

- **Face:** Angular, composed, controlled
- **Eyes:** Often emphasized by artists; appear intense, knowing, and unreadable
- **Expression:** Calm, faintly disdainful, or faintly amused; rarely openly emotional

Her face is not youthful in a conventional sense, but neither does it show age. She appears *finished* rather than old.

## Hair

- **Length:** Long, typically worn loose or simply restrained
- **Color:** Varies by depiction (often dark or dark auburn)
- **Presentation:** Natural flow rather than elaborate styling

Hair is used visually to reinforce her verticality and sense of continuity rather than ornamentation.

## Movement and Presence

- Morgan rarely rushes.
- She does not fidget.
- When she moves, it is with purpose, not momentum.

She is often framed as standing higher than others—on steps, above water, or simply by posture—reinforcing dominance without physical threat.

## Summary (For Quick Reference)

- **Tall:** Yes
- **Slender:** Yes
- **Physically imposing:** No
- **Visually dominant:** Absolutely

Morgan’s appearance communicates that she is not dangerous because she is strong, but because she is prepared—and has always been so.
