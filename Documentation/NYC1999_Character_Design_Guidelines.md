This game is about being exceptional. Your character will start with normal characteristics, which generally top out at 20, which is a 13- roll on 3d6. You can start with 2 skill levels in your exceptional skill, and one skill level in a related skill.

Must have at least one DNPC at risk to fall victim to street life (drugs, petty crime, prostitution, etc.)

I suggest your levels somehow apply to the various contests described below.

Contests happen in a five part hierarchy \-  
(1) Ranking \- stylized taunts aimed to score prestige as judged by the crowd. These can include gestures, graffiti, spoken words, and even pantomime. The point is always respect and disrespect recorded as street cred. (SC) not physical skills. The roll is a PRE skill: Oratory, or Persuasion (at \-1), or Acting (at \-2). It can also be professional skills based on PRE, e.g. PS: Rapper, PS: Gangster, PS: Community Organizer, etc.

(2) Battles \- these can actually be breaking, (never break dancing,) DJ-ing, painting, juggling, obstacle courses, yoyos, climbing, or any other physical skill, but are always called a battle. They too are judged by the crowd for SC. The roll is generally a DEX skill, e.g. Acrobatics or Climbing, but can also be professional skill based on INT (musician, rapper, etc.) or PRE (singer, actor, animal handler, etc) or DEX (dancer, juggler, rope jumper, etc.).

(3) Fights \- These are 1 on 1, without weapons, and fought to knockdown or humble, not injure. Crowd opinions can still matter here for determining SC)

(4) Rumbles \- This is a battle with anything but guns, and any number of folks. The goal is still to knockout or disable, not to permanently injure or kill. Individual SC is generally not earned in a rumble. Gangs can earn som SC this way, at the risk of being rounded up and jailed.

(5) Shootouts \- These are attacks with deadly weapons, and are often fatal or leave lasting injuries. (Lasting injuries are unusual in a Champions game, but I will be cruel about handing them out in this one) The group SC for a shootout is minimal, and the police crackdown afterwards is almost certain to the point of unfairness. Woe to anyone doing a public shoot-out in front of tourists.

\------------------------------------------------------- New Rules \-------------------------------------------------------  
STREET CRED  
battles (duels) can be won or lost based on street cred. This applied to . Losing a battle costs a point of street cred (SC) for that encounter. (They generally return overnight unless the loss is a total humiliation.)

RULE OF ESCALATION  
Escalating costs the initiator a point off their SC score per step of the battle hierarchy. For example, you just out-ranked a rival. They challenge you to battle over an obstacle course. They are now \-2 to their skill roll, 11 for just suffering a loss, and \-1 for escalating 1 level. This applies at all levels. For example, pulling a hidden gun (Shootout, \-4 escalation) after losing a ranking duel (-1) makes you \-5 OCV. Good luck making that shot, loser.

USING STREET CRED (IMPORTANT\!)  
Points of Street Cred add directly to applicable skill battles. This even applies to fights, rumbles and shootouts\! For example, a PC with 2 SmSC points for music, 1 MedSC point for Brooklyn, and 2 MedSC points for The Latin Kings would be \+5 in a jam battles where the audience was mostly Latin Kings from Brooklyn. The same PC would be only \+1 doing the same jam in Harlem with an audience of Bloods.

GM DISCRETION  
I will, occasionally, override the SC rules when I don't think the opponent thinks like a 'player'. This will have a consequence that the opponent will not gain and may lose SC, while the PC (who is, by definition a 'player') will probably gain extra from showing the opponent to be an ignoramus.

BUYING SC  
SC is bought with active points (AP) and experience points (XP) as positive reputation.  
\- Small (1 point per level) represents a community of interest across the city. The latter could be scientists, or street performers, or nightclub owners and patrons, or musicians, etc.  
\- Medium (2 points per level) represents a borough across all interests, or a city wide group. Groups are things like gangs, law enforcement, fire and safety, drug dealers, street racers, etc.  
\- Large (3 points per level) represents the whole city, including media, superheroes, government agencies, and average citizens. Large levels are not really Street Cred, because they generally count for nothing in street battles, and sometimes are seen as negatives, like "Who does this stuck-up reporter think they are? That press pass don't mean squat up here in Queens."

IMPROMPTU SC  
Some SC can be role-played into existence or into applying to ignoramuses. This is often done using complementary skill rolls. For example, the ranking skill could benefit from a complementary roll where Singing or Music skills would impress the crowd.

NO SC TRANSFER  
SC is character specific. A PC with a secret ID can only buy SC for either ID separately, but not combined.
