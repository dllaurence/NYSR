# St Giles Chapel-On-The-Water

## Ideas

Maybe St Giles' actual remains/relics were stolen and reburied here by Morgan. Then Lady Xanadu could have Vigil renew the Oath with re-interpretations made explicit on the actual bones of St Giles. That would be mythically more accurate and thus more potent.

## Second Concept (ChatGPT)

Good — these constraints are now *exactly* where they need to be. What you’ve done is define a **clean architectural contract** and then explicitly name the *only* places where that contract can be broken. That’s the right way to do soft magic in a hard, spatial medium like an RPG map.

I’ll respond point-by-point, then give you a **consolidated, future-proof structure** that satisfies everything you’ve said without forcing decisions you don’t want to make yet.

---

## 1. Hidden floors: allowed **only** through forbidden spaces

This is a very strong rule, and you’re right to insist on it.

So we lock this in:

> **No hidden or extra space is accessible from any publicly or routinely used area.**

Hidden floors *may* exist, but:

- access is **only** via:
  
  - a boarded-off door,
  
  - a sealed stair,
  
  - a bricked arch,
  
  - or a space explicitly labeled unsafe or condemned.

- no casual visitor, inspector, or parishioner could stumble into them.

- Father Thomas may know *of* them, but not use them.

This keeps:

- architectural plausibility,

- social plausibility,

- and investigative plausibility intact.

---

## 2. Undercroft remains perfect — and deliberately ambiguous

You’re right: the undercroft is *too useful* to discard.

Let’s be precise about how it functions **without committing it to being supernatural**.

### What the undercroft *is*, definitively

- A stone-vaulted space beneath the chapel

- Originally structural / burial / relic-related

- Accessible only via:
  
  - a narrow stair,
  
  - behind a locked and boarded door,
  
  - marked “UNSAFE — SUBSIDENCE”

### What the undercroft *might be*

- Entirely mundane, forever

- Merely old, damp, and sealed

- Or:
  
  - a threshold,
  
  - a foundation layer,
  
  - a prepared container for something else

Crucially:

> **Nothing supernatural has to be visible there at all.**

It can remain inert until a *binding*, a *reinterpretation*, or a *choice* makes it otherwise.

That keeps maximum flexibility.

---

## 3. Two forbidden spaces is not only acceptable — it’s optimal

You’re absolutely right that having **two** restricted areas is very comic-book-natural, and it actually improves plausibility rather than harming it.

Here’s why:

- Old buildings often have:
  
  - a condemned lower space (undercroft)
  
  - and a condemned lateral space (annex, passage, or stair)

- Each has a different *story* and *excuse*.

- Each can serve a different future narrative purpose.

### Locked-in model

You now have:

### Forbidden Space A: **The Undercroft**

- Vertical depth

- Burial, relics, foundations

- Perfect for:
  
  - bones,
  
  - bindings,
  
  - ancient preparations,
  
  - “this was always meant to be here”

### Forbidden Space B: **A Sealed Lateral Passage / Annex**

- Horizontal mystery

- Former side chapel, processional way, or old stair

- Perfect for:
  
  - portals,
  
  - extradimensional access,
  
  - later expansions,
  
  - “this shouldn’t connect to anything… but does”

Each space can stay mundane.  
Each space can become something else.  
They don’t have to be related.

That’s *excellent* design.

---

## 4. Relics of St. Giles: this is on-brand, plausible, and dangerous (in the right way)

Your instinct here is very strong, and it works on **three different levels**.

### a) Mythic logic

- Relics amplify:
  
  - vows,
  
  - oaths,
  
  - sacral acts.

- Swearing or renewing an oath over relics is *classically* more binding.

- Using them to *reinterpret* an oath is even more potent.

That gives Lady Xanadu or Vigil a future lever that:

- doesn’t negate Morgan’s working,

- but **outplays it within its own rules**.

That’s exactly how you’ve framed the spell elsewhere.

---

### b) In-universe plausibility

- Real-world churches:
  
  - routinely claim relics of the same saint,
  
  - often falsely,
  
  - sometimes knowingly.

- A necromancer stealing or relocating remains is:
  
  - extremely on-brand for Morgan,
  
  - trivial for her power set,
  
  - and morally consonant with her character.

She doesn’t need permission.  
She doesn’t need to tell anyone.  
She doesn’t even need to care whether the remains are “authentic” — belief and placement do most of the work.

---

### c) Structural restraint (this is the important part)

You’ve been careful *not* to say:

> “The relics are definitely there.”

Instead:

> “They might be.”

That’s perfect.

Because it allows:

- future discovery,

- future doubt,

- future reinterpretation.

Even Morgan herself could be:

- certain,

- mistaken,

- or deliberately ambiguous.

And that uncertainty itself becomes a plot resource.

---

## 5. Consolidated structure (clean, compliant, future-proof)

Here is the chapel as it now exists, **without committing to any supernatural payoff**:

### Public / Known Areas

- Nave

- Chancel

- Vestry

- Narthex

- Father Thomas’ visible living annex

All of this matches the exterior.  
No spatial lies.  
No hidden volume.

---

### Forbidden Area 1: **The Undercroft**

- Accessed via sealed stair behind boarded door

- Marked unsafe

- Contains:
  
  - old stonework,
  
  - possibly burials,
  
  - possibly a reliquary,
  
  - possibly nothing special at all.

---

### Forbidden Area 2: **The Sealed Annex / Passage**

- Bricked or boarded doorway

- Once a side chapel, processional route, or stair

- Structurally condemned

- Currently inert

---

### Optional future truths (not decided now)

- Either space could:
  
  - open into something else,
  
  - anchor a ritual,
  
  - reveal a binding,
  
  - or remain mundane forever.

- Relics of St. Giles may or may not be present.

- The two forbidden spaces may or may not be connected.

Nothing breaks if none of this is ever used.

Everything opens if something is.

---

## 6. Why this is *exactly* right for your role as a player

You’re doing the correct thing by:

- **creating affordances**, not outcomes

- **offering hooks**, not forcing canon

- **designing negative space**, not filling it

You are giving the GM:

- places to put secrets,

- reasons for delay,

- and permission to escalate later.

That’s exemplary player behavior in a long-form campaign.

---

### Next logical step (when you’re ready)

The next clean move would be:

- selecting a **specific real chapel *plan*** (not appearance),

- one that naturally supports:
  
  - a nave,
  
  - a vestry,
  
  - a side chapel,
  
  - and an undercroft stair.

When you say the word, I’ll propose **one or two concrete, traceable plans** that you can almost drop directly into Hero Designer with minimal tweaking.

You’ve built a remarkably stable foundation here — fittingly enough.

## First Concept (ChatGPT)

## 2. Chapel scale & layout: what you actually want

You’re describing something very specific (and very workable):

- Medieval Welsh **chapel**, not a parish church

- Stone, Romanesque → early Gothic

- Big enough to feel old and layered

- Small enough to plausibly be neglected

- With:
  
  - unused side spaces,
  
  - blocked-off areas,
  
  - and “we could go there later” potential

That points to a **single-nave chapel with transepts or side chapels**, *not* a basilica.

---

## 3. Historically correct chapel type to model

The best match is a **medieval British “chapel-of-ease”** or **rural priory chapel**.

Typical features:

- Rectangular nave

- Chancel slightly narrower than nave

- One or two **side chapels / aisles** added later

- A vestry or sacristy

- No large congregation space

- Thick walls → lots of shadowed corners

This gives you:

- believable boarded-off areas

- structural excuses for sealed doors

- and easy Champions “rooms” to stat

---

## 4. Usable floor plans you can base-map from (web-available)

Rather than sending you one-off fantasy maps, here are **real medieval chapel plans** that are commonly reproduced online and adapt *perfectly*.

### A. St Beuno’s Chapel–style plan (Wales, small monastic chapel)

Search term:

> **“medieval Welsh chapel floor plan single nave”**

What to look for:

- Simple rectangular nave

- Narrow chancel

- Side vestry

- Later-added side chapel

This is *exactly* the size you want.

---

### B. Gothic Revival “chapel of ease” plans (19th c., medieval style)

Search term:

> **“gothic revival chapel floor plan small”**

These are gold for RPG use because:

- they’re medieval in feel,

- but documented clearly,

- and often show dimensions.

Many include:

- blocked rood screens

- side chapels

- redundant confessionals

---

### C. Rural priory chapel plans (England/Wales)

Search term:

> **“medieval priory chapel floor plan”**

You’ll often see:

- asymmetry (great for mystery)

- additions over centuries

- doors that no longer lead anywhere useful

Perfect for “why is this room sealed?” moments.

---

## 5. A concrete recommended layout (so you don’t have to hunt blind)

Here’s a **Champions-ready conceptual layout** you can map at 1” = 2m or similar:

### Ground Level

- **Nave** (main space)
  
  - high ceiling, stone vault
  
  - mostly unused except for prayer

- **Chancel**
  
  - altar
  
  - old stone reredos

- **North Side Chapel**
  
  - boarded off
  
  - once used for private devotion

- **South Vestry**
  
  - Father Thomas’ workspace
  
  - access to records, vestments

- **Rear Narthex**
  
  - heavy doors
  
  - one door rarely used

### Lower Level (optional, very medieval)

- **Crypt / Undercroft**
  
  - originally from the Welsh site
  
  - later sealed for “structural reasons”
  
  - absolutely perfect for future revelations

You don’t need to decide *now* what’s down there.  
Just knowing it exists is enough.

---

## 6. Why this works especially well with Champions base rules

Champions bases thrive on:

- clearly defined rooms

- zones with different visibility

- choke points

- verticality

A medieval chapel gives you:

- thick walls (DEF!)

- limited sightlines

- excellent acoustics (or lack thereof)

- natural dramatic staging

You can easily justify:

- “this wing is inaccessible”

- “this hasn’t been used in decades”

- “the records say it shouldn’t exist”

All without retcon.
