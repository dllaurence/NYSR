# Smuggler Cove

**St. Giles-on-the-River** stands on a low rise along the **north shore of Swindler Cove**, overlooking a sheltered reach of the Harlem River just before it bends into Spuyten Duyvil Creek.

A narrow stone path descends from the chapel’s rear to the water’s edge, screened by vegetation and protected from view by the cove’s breakwater. At dawn, the site is quiet enough that voices carry—but not far enough to be heard.

- Swindler Cove sits on the **east shore of Upper Manhattan**

- On the **Harlem River**

- Just before the river bends west and becomes **Spuyten Duyvil Creek**

- Opposite the **Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse**

- Partially enclosed by a **breakwater / jetty** that protects the cove

### Swindler Cove advantages

- Sheltered water → calm, reflective surface

- Jetty blocks casual river traffic sightlines

- Limited pedestrian flow compared to Inwood Hill Park

- Feels like a **working edge**, not a destination

- Plausible for:
  
  - early-morning emptiness,
  
  - unnoticed rituals,
  
  - astral manifestations

- **Name**: *St. Giles-on-the-River* / *St. Giles’ Chapel-on-the-River*

- **Site**: Ancient Gaian land at Swindler Cove

- **Architect**: Morgan le Fay (engineered, not improvised)

- **Caretaker**: Father Thomas Hale, antiquarian traditionalist

Location

(Based on Downloaded Images)

When you look at these, imagine:

- the chapel **just inland** from the visible shoreline,

- partially obscured by trees,

- with a stone path angling down behind it.

You *do not* need to invent much:

- vegetation is already there,

- isolation is already believable,

- the river feels close and quiet, not grand.

**I've added a old, dilapidated dock at the end of the stone path.**

Me

According to Google maps the north shore of Swindler Cove is at 40d 52m 21.4s N, 73d 55m 22.4s W, on the East shore of Upper Manhattan on the Harlem River before it turns left and becomes Spuyten Duyvil Creek. It's right across the cove from the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse label on what must be a jetty or breakwall protecting the Cove.

Using your reference point and refining it slightly inland (so the chapel isn’t literally in the water):

### 📍 **St. Giles-on-the-River — corrected anchor**

**40.8726° N, 73.9229° W** ← ❌ *old / wrong*

### ✅ **Correct Swindler Cove anchor**

**40.8726° N, 73.9220° W** (shoreline)  
**40.8725° N, 73.9223° W** (slightly inland rise — *recommended chapel site*)

If you prefer DMS (matching your format):

- **40° 52′ 21.4″ N, 73° 55′ 22.4″ W** — north shore of Swindler Cove

- Chapel sits **just west/southwest of this point**, elevated a few meters

### Muscota Marsh / Indian Caves problem (as you saw)

- Heavy foot traffic

- Recreational use

- Clear sightlines

- Already culturally “known”

- Too many eyes, too much daylight activity

# Inwood Park (1-1.3 mi away)

Advantages

- interesting,

- mythically tempting,

- So Morgan might use it.

But it's not appropriate for the Chapel

- **far too open, busy, and visible** for what you want.
